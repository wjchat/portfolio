    RedBull: <p>Red Bull Curates: Villa Riad was a spectacularly lively event held in Chicago on the last Sunday of Lollapalloza, featuring DJ performances and plenty of unique and interesting curators. My team and I worked in conjunction with Roxwell (an event company based in Chicago) to create a very much living website for this event where guests could RSVP, sign up for email-notifications, and be alerted to announcements of performers and sponsers. The version of <a href = '//www.redbullcurateschi.com' target = '_blank'>redbullcurateschi.com</a> shown here has been replaced by a post-event version and the site will continue to grow and change.</p>,
    Opener: 'I love the process of working with creative, wild people. It’s my ambition to work in many creative realms, bridging people and ideas, coming to exhilirating solutions. Right now, I’m immersing myself in the digital realm and familiarizing myself with it’s unique challenges and wonderful freedoms. Use this site to see a bit of me and what I’ve learned, as well as a several of my professional endeavors.',
    Papuga: <p>Papuga Transportation is a handicap ride-service based in south-east Michigan. My team was hired to create a website for the folks at Papuga and help them restructure their business model, transitioning from paper to digital. The website we made for Papuga allows clients to schedule, reschedule, and cancel rides online and is helping Papuga streamline their services. Givin the target demographic, accessability was key and influenced much of our designs. To explore more of the site than what is shown in this demo, visit <a href = '//www.papugatransportation.com' target = "_blank">papugatransportation.com</a> and sign up for an account.</p>,
