    RedBull: 'Red Bull Curates: Villa Riad was a spectacularly lively event held in Chicago on the last Sunday of Lollapalloza, featuring DJ performances and plenty of unique and interesting curators. My team and I worked in conjunction with Roxwell (an event company based in Chicago) to create a very much living website for this event where guests could RSVP, sign up for email-notifications, and be alerted to announcements of performers and sponsers. The version of redbullcurateschi.com shown here has been replaced by a post-event version and the site will continue to grow and change. ',
